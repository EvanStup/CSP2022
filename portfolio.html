    <h2>1.1.9 Project: Ice Cream Machine</h2>
    <h2>The Ice Cream Machine allows the user to customize their very own ice cream cone. Using different inputs, 
	    the user can choose their number of scoops (1 or 2), flavor (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, mint),
	    and toppings (sprinkles, cherry).</h2>

	<h2>1.2.5 Project: Fishing Game</h2>
    	<h2>In the Fishing Game, the user clicks on different fish to catch them. The fish spawn randomly(there's even
		a whale) and move in different directions. Different fish are worth more points, which are added to the 
		user's score when the fish is clicked. If the points are high enough at the end, the user makes it to 
		the leaderboard.</h2>
	    <h2>1.3.1 Project: Superhero E-card</h2>
	    <h2>In this project, we sent a e-card to kids in a childrens' hospital. We sent them kind and encouraging
		    messages. The kids would be able to interact by pressing a button to start the animations, and the
		    superhero would fly away at the end.</h2>
